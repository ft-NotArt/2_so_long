# ⭐ **SO_LONG** ⭐

### **Here's my so_long, a very cool project in which we have to code a labyrinth video game using a given graphic library**

## Inspiration

I got inspired the theme of my so_long when I came across this art from **kidd** ([@WeSatInTheCar](https://x.com/WeSatInTheCar)) on Twitter :

## Gameplay

The main idea behind the game is that enemies will try to attack you if you come too close, but you need to get rid of them in order to go to the next stage\
To do so, you'll also be able to attack them !\
You'll start with only a simple attack, but with the power to absorb those of your enemies, thus becoming stronger as you go through more foes
### Hard Mode
When compiling using the Makefile, you could use the `make hard` rule to launch the game as yoshi instead of kirby !\
Doing so, you'll give up your ability to absorb enemies powers !

## Levels

I made 4 maps to play the game as pleasantly as possible, I hope you'll like them\
Those were made to be played in this order :
* whispy_woods
* fountains_of_dream
* factory
* boss_room

## Commands

There isn't that much to be done so commands are pretty straightforward\
You can use either **WASD** & **123** *(num pad)* OR **↑←↓→** & **123** *(above letters)*\
And that's all ! (I think ?)
